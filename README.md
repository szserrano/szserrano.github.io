# Welcome to the source code for my portfolio website!

I use Vite, React Native, and 3js as my tech stack for the creation of this site. I've thoroughly enjoyed importing 3D interactive models within my page and aim to update my projects as I plan to make more of them.

When making changes, I always make a dedicated branch for said changes, merge, and run a couple commands:  
- `npm run predeploy` - this makes a build  
- `npm run deploy` - this publishes the build to gh-pages to be reflected on my portfolio site
